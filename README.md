Initial Github Repository
<hr>
This repository was created to help me understand exactly how to utilize my Github account. Github seems to be a place that I can host my web projects online while maintaining an active folder sync on my computer. I can dig it.

I have a decent knowledge of html and css. I have been able to gain a beginners understanding of php, but know next to nothing about javascript. My intention is to dive head first into these two coding systems, especially javascript, in order to grow into a stronger web designer. I have already designed for a few clients. Most of the few are designed simple, as an online business card. One of them belongs to my girlfriend of five plus years. She is a burlesque performer. This site was one of the early designs I did. I purchesed a responsive theme and using the power of deduction I simplified it into something very useful, but fairly straight forward. It is a media heavy site to promote her as a burlesque performer. I'm very proud of my work. Some day I hope to write and design using purely "my own" code. I also intend to take some online graphic design courses through my local community college. I have a passion for web design. It is a perfect blend of technical coding and visual creativeness which describes my personality very well.
